# Bean Injection with XML

This repository demonstrates a three-layer Java application leveraging XML-based bean injection to manage dependencies within the controller and business layers.

Key Features:

Three-Layer Architecture:
  Controller layer: Handles web endpoints and user interactions.
  Service layer (business logic): Encapsulates business rules and operations.
  Data access layer: Interacts with the database or other external data sources.
  XML-Based Bean Injection:
  Beans are defined and configured within XML configuration files.
  The Spring framework injects dependencies into the appropriate classes.
  Web Endpoint Handling:
  Controller classes manage incoming HTTP requests and responses.
  They delegate business logic to the service layer.
  
Project Structure:

  src/main/java: Contains the Java source code for the application.
  controllers: Controller classes handling web endpoints.
  services: Business logic classes implementing application functionality.
  repositories: Interfaces for data access (implementations might use JDBC, JPA, or other data access technologies).
  src/main/resources: Contains resources like configuration files.
  applicationContext.xml: Defines the beans for dependency injection.
  (Other configuration files as needed)
  pom.xml: Maven project file managing dependencies and build process.
  
Getting Started:

  Clone the repository.
  Import the project into your IDE.
  Ensure you have Maven installed.
  Run mvn clean install to build the project.
  Deploy the application to a web server or run it locally using Spring Boot.
